"""Transition Analysis Service for qontinui-runner.

This service identifies state transitions from video, correlating visual changes
with input events. It determines both the outgoing action (which StateImage was
clicked) and incoming recognition (which StateImages appeared in the new state).

Key Concepts:
    - Outgoing (Action): The GUI action that triggers the transition (e.g., click on StateImage)
    - Incoming (Recognition): The appearance of StateImages in the destination state

The service processes captured video frames, detected states, and input events to
automatically build a complete transition graph for GUI automation.
