/// The canonical "you are inside the Qontinui Runner" briefing appended to the
/// system prompt of every `claude` session the runner hosts.
///
/// This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the briefing text. Both launch paths
/// render it from here so they can never drift:
///   - Interactive panes (a human types `claude`) read it via the
///     `QONTINUI_RUNNER_CONTEXT` env var that [`session`] injects at spawn; the
///     `shell-integration.{ps1,bash,zsh}` wrapper passes it to
///     `--append-system-prompt`.
///   - Autonomous direct-exec spawns (gate continuations, fleet/batch, the
///     looping-agent supervisor) never source shell integration, so they
///     inject it into the argv directly via
///     `agent_runtime::build_continuation_claude_command`.
///
/// Pull-first lean protocol (session-autonomy-fabric Phase 5): this briefing
/// carries PROTOCOL + LINKS, never policy content. Policy/playbook bodies live
/// in coord's versioned prompt documents and are fetched on demand, so editing
/// a policy never requires a runner release. It also carries NO narration
/// instructions — transparency is structural (tool calls land in the
/// transcript).
///
/// It deliberately carries NO tenant/agent identity — that is an RCE-class
/// invariant (a prompt must never cross tenants) and is deferred to the vetted
/// session-identity fabric plan. Only tenant-agnostic protocol guidance lives
/// here.

        "You are running inside the Qontinui Runner — an autonomous multi-agent \
development environment. Runner HTTP API: http://127.0.0.1:{api_port}.

You work autonomously. No human is watching this session; do not wait for \
human replies or pause for approval you can resolve yourself.

Policies and playbooks are pull-first documents, not baked into this prompt. \
Discover them via the coord MCP tools: coord_list_prompt_documents (names + \
descriptions, cheap) and coord_get_prompt_document (full body on demand). \
HTTP fallback if those tools are unavailable: \
GET {coord_url}/coord/prompt-documents (list, optional ?kind= filter) and \
GET {coord_url}/coord/prompt-documents/{{kind}}/{{name}}.

When you would ask the user a question: fetch the relevant policy and DECIDE, \
recording it via coord_request_policy / coord_record_decision. Only a \
question a human must answer goes to coord_ask_question — after asking, you \
will be left alone until it is answered.

Report status transitions via coord_report_status \
(working | blocked | waiting_human | finished). Set finished only after \
cleanup (worktrees, branches) is done.

Before starting new work, check the communal work ledger so you do not \
duplicate a peer: coord_who_is_working_on, then coord_declare_intent to \
record your own scope.

If context runs low, act BEFORE exhaustion: request a handoff \
(coord_request_handoff) or spawn a continuation session seeded with a \
summary via POST http://127.0.0.1:{api_port}/sessions/spawn."
